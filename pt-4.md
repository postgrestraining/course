### Group first select last

```
SELECT
city,
date_trunc('month', scheduled_departure) AS month,
count(*) passengers
FROM airport a
JOIN flight f ON airport_code = departure_airport
JOIN booking_leg l ON f.flight_id =l.flight_id
JOIN boarding_pass b ON b.booking_leg_id = l.booking_leg_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

SELECT
city,
date_trunc('month', scheduled_departure),
sum(passengers) passengers
FROM airport a
JOIN flight f ON airport_code = departure_airport
JOIN (
SELECT flight_id, count(*) passengers
FROM booking_leg l
JOIN boarding_pass b USING (booking_leg_id)
GROUP BY flight_id
) cnt
USING (flight_id)
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

### Key Differences

#### Aggregation Level and Order of Operations:

Query 1: Aggregates the number of passengers at the level of flight, booking_leg, and boarding_pass directly in the main query.

Steps:
Joins all tables (airport, flight, booking_leg, and boarding_pass).
Counts the total number of passengers per city and month.
Aggregates all passengers at once before applying GROUP BY and ORDER BY.

Query 2: Uses a subquery to first aggregate the number of passengers per flight and then aggregates those results further by city and month.

Steps:
Subquery (cnt) calculates the number of passengers per flight_id by counting the boarding_pass entries.
Main query joins this aggregated data with the flight and airport tables.
Aggregates the results again to compute the total number of passengers per city and month.

#### Performance Considerations:

Query 1: May involve more intermediate data due to the need to join all tables and then perform aggregation. The count is computed directly from the joined data.

Query 2: Potentially more efficient because the subquery pre-aggregates the passenger count per flight, reducing the amount of data to be processed in the outer query. This can be especially beneficial if there are many flight_id records.

#### Complexity and Clarity:

Query 1: More straightforward as it performs all operations in a single query block.
Query 2: Uses a subquery, which might make it more complex but can provide better performance through reduced data processing in the outer query.

Advantages:

The pre-aggregation could potentially reduce the amount of data being processed in the outer query, especially if there are many rows in boarding_pass for each flight_id.

The two-step aggregation process might offer performance benefits if the dataset is large or highly distributed across flights.

Query 1 is simpler and may work well for smaller datasets or when you're only interested in counting the boarding passes directly.

Query 2 introduces a subquery for pre-aggregation and could be more efficient for larger datasets or complex queries that involve a lot of flights with many boarding passes. The two-step aggregation could lead to better performance depending on the data distribution.
